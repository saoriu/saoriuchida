              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>Why React?</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>
                My journey with React started in 2020, during the pandemic. Coming from a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I saw React as a means to elevate my web development skills and channel my passion for web design, focusing on creating more dynamic, beautiful, and interactive web experiences. React's component-based architecture and its seamless integration with modern JavaScript appealed to me. It offered a way to build dynamic, responsive web applications efficiently, leveraging my existing knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>Hooking up</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>
                I found that transitioning to React hooks from traditional React patterns was a game-changer. These enabled me to utilize state and other React features without needing to write a class. This shift not only simplified my code, but also made it more comprehensible and easier to maintain.

              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>This project</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>
                I used a component-driven approach to develop this project, breaking down the UI into reusable components using JSX. For the OpenAI API, I created OpenAiForm.js with useState, useRef, and useEffect hooks. I used axios to securely communicate with the AWS API Gateway. The AnimatedBackground.js component uses useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and handle lifecycle events. It includes color-shifting wedges with a shuffle array function for color variation and dynamic positioning. Finally, I added an opacity effect on component mounting for enhanced visual appeal.

              <p className='modal-text'>
                In this project, I demonstrated my ability to integrate AI by connecting a React application with OpenAI's GPT-4. I went beyond simple integration and leveraged the fine-tuning capabilities of OpenAI to create a personalized model. This model was trained on data about my personal and professional experiences, allowing it to generate responses and content that are tailored to represent my digital persona.

              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>Technical Implementation</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>
                The integration involves a robust backend infrastructure using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. AWS Lambda serves as the intermediary, ensuring secure communication between the frontend and OpenAI's API without exposing sensitive keys. The API Gateway acts as a controlled access point, providing a RESTful endpoint for frontend requests. This setup not only secures the API key but also enables scalable and efficient request handling, essential for real-time AI interactions.

              <p className='modal-text'>
                Although over-hyped, AI has serious potential. Generative language models like GPT-4 are changing how we interact with digital content. By leveraging these models and with my background in UX design and my experience with Python, I can sift through the hype to create valuable experiences for users. This project exemplifies my ability to create dynamic, responsive, and personalized digital touchpoints that engage users in meaningful ways.</p>

              <p className='modal-text'>The purpose of this project was to showcase my skills in API integration, AWS services, and cybersecurity principles. I developed this site as a React application that interacts with OpenAI's API, but instead of directly exposing the API key in the frontend, I created a secure and efficient backend solution using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.</p>

              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>AWS Lambda Function</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>I created a Lambda function in AWS using Node.js that acts as a middleware between my React app and OpenAI's API. The Lambda function securely stores the OpenAI API key and handles API requests from my frontend application. I also implemented error handling within the function to manage any unexpected interactions with the OpenAI API.</p>
              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>AWS API Gateway Configuration</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>I set up an API Gateway in AWS to expose a REST endpoint and configured the endpoint to trigger the Lambda function upon receiving a request. I also utilized API Gateway's built-in features for request validation, rate limiting, and CORS configuration to enhance security and reliability.</p>
              <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>Security Measures</h3>
              <p className='modal-text'>By using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, I ensured that the OpenAI API key is never exposed to the frontend, mitigating the risk of key compromise. I configured appropriate IAM roles and policies in AWS for the principle of least privilege, ensuring that the Lambda function has only the necessary permissions. To track any unusual activities or errors, I enabled logging and monitoring through AWS CloudWatch.</p>

                <p className='modal-text'>Early in my career I sought to blend economic policy and data science, so I seized a pivotal opportunity to intern with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). This internship aligned perfectly with my aspiration at the time, to operate at the highest level of international government.</p>
                <p className='modal-text mini'>Fun fact: My dream at the time was to work for the CIA, but I later learned they only hire Americans so figured the UN was the next best thing!</p>

                <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>The High Level Panel</h3>
                <p className='modal-text'>My tenure as an Economic Affairs Intern was primarily dedicated to supporting the FACTI Panel‚ÄîThe High-Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency, and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda. Convened by the 74th President of the United Nations General Assembly and the 75th President of the Economic and Social Council in March 2020, the FACTI Panel was a beacon of global efforts in enhancing financial accountability and integrity, key pillars in realizing the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>
                <p className='modal-text'>The panel's mandate was broad yet clear: scrutinize prevailing challenges and trends in financial accountability, transparency, and integrity, and furnish evidence-based recommendations to bridge gaps in the international system. Co-chaired by the esteemed  former Prime Minister of Niger, Ibrahim Assane Mayaki and the former President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitƒó, the panel consisted of a diverse group of experts and world leaders, each contributing their rich perspectives and insights.</p>

                <h3 className='modal-subtitle'>A master class in consensus-building</h3>
                <p className='modal-text'>At a critical juncture of the project‚Äîwhen the high-level members were negotiating to reach a consensus on global recommendations‚ÄîI was deeply involved in the thick of political debate and consensus-building. This exposure was instrumental in honing my skills in stakeholder management and project management.</p>
                <p className='modal-text'>A significant part of my responsibility involved conducting econometric research, particularly around trade misinvoicing, one of the panel's focal areas. This task was not just about data analysis; it encompassed marketing research and storytelling, skills vital in product management for understanding and communicating complex concepts effectively.</p>
                <p className='modal-text'>My culminating project was to design and build the landing page and executive summary for the panel's final report, employing HTML and CSS. This task was a testament to my technical acumen and ability to deliver tangible products that communicate complex ideas in an accessible manner.</p>

                <p className='modal-text'>Leveraging the full capabilities of Adobe Creative Suite, particularly Adobe Photoshop, I mastered complex techniques such as layer masking, advanced compositing, and color grading to create high-quality visual assets. My proficiency in Photoshop's 3D rendering and image manipulation enabled me to deliver striking visuals that elevated brand messaging. Using CodePen, I created interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript snippets for landing pages, ensuring they were responsive and engaging. Over my tenure, I produced hundreds of assets and landing pages that significantly boosted marketing initiatives and activations.</p>
